My preferred editor is Visual Studio Code because for two reasons. 
The first reason is that you can use add-ons which makes coding 
much easier because there are add-ons for almost anything. 
There is stlying add-ons, debugging add-ons, and many more. 
The second reason why I like VS Code is because there is a 
built-in terminal and as well as git. I use windows and 
having a built-in terminal and git in the code editor 
makes my life much easier and more organized.
